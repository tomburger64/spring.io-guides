# https://spring.io/guides

As a complete beginner when it comes to backend, and after also trying courses on Spring that are absolutely not beginner friendly (not explaining much but the big picture of what's happening) I decided to look at another way of learning Spring...
To be fair I could learn like that, it's just that going to AI models to ask "what does that do" and "why did I just write that" every 2 lines of code on a 1 hour long course is really the opposite of motivating

Sooooo after looking up more ways of learning Spring (to then understand what happens in Spring Boot when I'll come to it), I decided to go with the spring.io guides which seems to be pretty well reputed over some subreddits.
